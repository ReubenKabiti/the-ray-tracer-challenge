# The ray tracer challenge
This is a ray tracer challenge I am trying out from the book of the same name by Jamis Buck. This is still a work in progress and I am\
planning to redo it in Python if I complete this one.

The book doesn't use any specific programming language for its examples, so if you wanna try the challenge you can pick it up. I highly\
recommend it.
